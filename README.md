Make sure you have Ollama installed → [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai).

### Streamlit Cloud Deployment

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to [https://share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io).
3. Deploy by selecting your repo and `app.py`.

⚠️ **Note**: Ollama models won’t run on Streamlit Cloud.
If you want the chatbot to work online, replace Ollama with a cloud model (OpenAI, HuggingFace, or Groq API).
